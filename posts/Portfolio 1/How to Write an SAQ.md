#### Practice

A. One of the key technologies that enabled expansion into the New World would be the astrolabe. It was a tool that could analyze the positions of stars with great accuracy.. As seen in numerous texts from the time, most notably being one concerning "1000 uses" for the astrolabe, it allowed for more precise latitude navigation at sea. This not only made travel more safe and accessible, but it allowed for faster route finding. Additionally, new sails were developed. These triangular sails, called lateen sails, allowed sailors to go against the flow of the wind with greater speed, and helped them travel up the west coast of Africa. Finally, another key innovation was the use of the magnetic compass. It had a needle that pointed north at all times, allowing for accurate and precise navigation. Similar to the astrolabe, this provided an easier way to find direction at sea. As a result, travel could again be safer.

B. Joint-Stock companies provided an affordable, innovative way for voyages to be funded. By having stockholders each purchase shares, money could be raised for voyages. Additionally, profits could be reinvested in the the company, allowing for further growth. Another way that funding was gained comes from the direct selling of cash crops. Companies and kingdoms who wished to send explorer's could issue a loan, expecting payment in the form of the luxuries provided via the New World. Furthermore, companies with a presence in the area already could divest the funds gained from farming, exploration, and mining to pay for future expeditions. And finally, one of the other ways money was acquired came in the form of slavery, with the sale of people from the New World being a lucrative way to gain money quickly.

C. There were three main motivations for exploration: God, glory, and gold. Discounting gold (pun intended), the other two drives proved compelling for explorers. In such a time where missionaries were so devoted, many were driven to go to the New World. One notable example is Bartolomeu de la Casa, who decided to travel in order to convert the native population. Spain was very prominent during the time, building various religious buildings and spreading Catholicism. For other explorer's, glory was a main force pushing them to travel. Anyone who went to the New World and returned was likely to be seen as courageous and brave; this motivated many to set out on expeditions. Finally, one other reason people explored was land. Colonizing the New World promised whoever went a large amount of land, which appealed to many who had none prior. As such, they moved over in droves to the Americas.
