1a: Contextualization (Broad Context) "Lead in"
	What led to this moment
1b: Thesis | Claim
	This happened *because* 
2: Evidence (In the period!!!!!!!!!!!!!)
	2 pieces of evidence needed! 4 recommended
	Specific and relevant to the prompt
	"**Evidence (Underlined)**, what it is"
3: Conclusion (Analysis and Reasoning)
	Complexity can be put only here.
	"My essay is complex because"
	Cause/effect, continuity/change
	If you "explain how multiple pieces of specific and relative evidence [4 total] that supports your complex thesis,"" you get the point.
	Rule of 5! Do 5 pieces of evidence
	

LITERALLY JUST PUT "MY CONTEXTUALIZATION IS" etc.
