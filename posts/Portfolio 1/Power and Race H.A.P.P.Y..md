H - The man shown is The Second Lord Baltimore Cecilius (Cecil) Calvert. His father had applied for a charter to settle Maryland earlier, thought it wasn't approved until 1632, after his death. As a result, Cecil became the Lord Proprietor of Maryland, and was in charge of the colony. The photo shows him in 1670 or so holding a map of Maryland (wherein he never actually visited), with his grandson and heir apparent by his side. In the background, a slave was shown to depict his high wealth and social status.

A - This would have been intended for other nobility, as evidenced by the slave being shown to brag about wealth. Additionally, he's holding a map of Maryland, demonstrating his accomplishments and adding an air of adventure.

P - The power of Lord Baltimore. It was a bragging painting showing who was in charge of the [[Chesapeake Region]]. Again, this was likely made to attract attention to colonization by showing the wealth and power resulting from expansion. 

P - The painting was made in reverence of Calvert. It's painted head on, with him looking at the painter, standing tall and dominant. Very positively biased towards Calvert. Note: could be seen as negative due to [[Presentism and Bias]]

Y - This represents a clear indicator of the power dynamic in early America. Additionally, it shows the English "caste" system, and would have helped incentivize settlement. Everything in the image is lavish and luxurious, even the painting, showing [[Useful Words |affluence]] for the nobility.
